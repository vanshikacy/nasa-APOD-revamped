## ðŸ”® Why This Exists

This was originally built when I was still learning JS.  
Now after earning my freeCodeCamp JS + Responsive Web Design certs, I came back to give it the glow-up it deserved â€” better logic as well as better UI.  
Sometimes the best way to show your growth isnâ€™t starting something new â€” itâ€™s leveling up something old.
